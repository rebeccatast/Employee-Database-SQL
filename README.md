# Employee Database
The goal of this project was to investigate employees from 1980s and 1990s at Pewlett Hackard. The first step was to inspect the CSV files (found in the data folder) to find variables that were common between files, identify primary and foreign keys, and specify data types. An ERD (found in EmployeeSQL folder) of the files was created to sketch out each of these varible connections. 

After the ERD was created, each of the CSV files was imported into the appropriate SQL table. Once the database was complete, SQL was used to run the following analyses:
  - List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary for each employee. 
  - List the first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
  - List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
  - List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  - List the first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
  - List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  - List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  - List the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name in descending order.
